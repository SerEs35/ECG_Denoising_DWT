# ECG_Denoising_DWT

This work is about using the Discrete Wavelet Transform for "denoising" an electrocardiogram, in this case a recorded sample taken from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database. The project was done in Matlab, and the wavelet selected was the Coiflet4.

The files in this repository are described as follows:
\118e00m_n.mat
>Is an ECG sample file from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database

\my_ecg_test.m
>This is the code of the project, done in Matlab.
