# ECG_Denoising_DWT
----------------------

This work is about using the Discrete Wavelet Transform for "denoising" an electrocardiogram, and be able to extract the QRS complex from it.

For this project, a recorded sample taken from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database was used. The project was done in Matlab, and the wavelet selected was the Coiflet4.
